Self-Consumption Toolbox
========================

### Description
A toolbox for the simulation and economic evaluation of self-consumption and solar home battery systems.

The code is written in Python (v2.7). The data is saved as pandas dataframes within pickle or hdf files. 

The toolbox computes self-consumption indicators for different PV and household demand profiles. Some profiles are historical measured profiles, some others are reconstructed from typical daily profiles. Due to the diversity of consumption patterns, the results can vary significantly from one household to the other.

### Getting started
To get familiar with the different function of the toolbox, it is recommended to read the description and run the files with the suffix "Example" in the "SC_ToolBox" folder.

The database of synthetic household profiles is stored in the hdf format in the "Synthetic Household Profiles" folder.
